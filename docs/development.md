# Development

## Baseline

- Go 1.26
- two daemons: `authd` and `gamed`
- dedicated ops/pprof server per daemon
- Docker multi-stage build with lightweight runtime image

## Commands

```bash
make test
make build
```

Run locally:

```bash
go run ./cmd/authd
go run ./cmd/gamed
```

## Public CI

The repository ships with a GitHub Actions baseline workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

It currently validates:

- `gofmt` cleanliness
- `go test ./...`
- `go vet ./...`
- daemon builds for `authd` and `gamed`
- Docker runtime and debug image builds

The intent is simple: every small slice should be pushable and publicly re-checkable.

## Runtime configuration

### authd
- `METIN2_AUTHD_PPROF_ADDR` (default `:6061`)

### gamed
- `METIN2_GAMED_PPROF_ADDR` (default `:6060`)

### global override
- `METIN2_PPROF_ADDR`

## Legacy session runtime hooks

The legacy TCP runtime supports two optional per-session hooks:

- `FlushServerFrames() ([][]byte, error)` — allows a session flow to emit server-initiated frames even when no new client packet has arrived yet
- `io.Closer` — allows a session flow to release shared runtime state when the TCP session ends

The runtime checks for pending server frames between client reads.
This is the foundation for future slices such as asynchronous peer visibility and other server-push behavior.

## Initial engineering priorities

1. freeze TMP4 target client compatibility
2. define boot-path packet matrix
3. implement TCP framing tests
4. implement session state machine tests
5. implement handshake/login/select/create/enter/move incrementally
